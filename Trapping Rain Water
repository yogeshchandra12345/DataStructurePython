Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1. 
Write a program to compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

class Solution(object):
    # @param A, a list
    # @return an integer
    def maxWaterTrapped(self, a):
        # write your awesome code here
        if len(a)<2 :
            return 0
        first = a[0]
        second = a[1]
        result =0 
        for i in a[1:]:
            second = i
            if second > first:
                first = second
                second = None
            else:
                result += first-second
        second = 0 
        if second < first:
            for i in a[::-1]:
                second = max(second,i)
                if second != first and second < first:
                    result -= first-second
                else:
                    break
        return result
